### Overview
In this project

For the sake of this project I did data cleaning in Power BI. Normally I would do it in Excel since it is easier and with more options. I used *Transform Data* in Navigator screen.  I deleted unnecessary columns, I used split column to clean up columns 'Q1, Q4, Q5 and Q11, I duplicated column Q3 then I splitted the range into two columns with min and max value and I added new column "Average Salary" where I computed average of min and max columns.  

I create folowing visualizations.  

**Card** - One card is showing number of survey takers and second card shows their average age.  
**Stacked Barchart** - This vizualization shows average salary per job title.  
**Stacked Column Chart** - This vizualization shows in a column for each language usage per job title.  
**Treemap** - This vizualization breaks survey takers by country. When you click on a country you will see relevant figures for that particular country in other vizualizations.  
**Gauge** - This vizualization scale 0-10 one gauge shows happines with work/life balance and second one shows happines with salary.  
**Donut Chart** - This vizualization show how employees perceived difficulty starting carriers in their fields.
